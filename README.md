# Iris-Classification
# Description:
Iris Classification is a machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying different classification algorithms.
